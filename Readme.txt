# MordCraft version 0.1 
(hopefully there will be a beta release candidate soon)

## --------------  Thanks  -------------

2cool, for getting me going in the Mordhau modding scene.
'Solved' because he always answered my questions
varinathras, for helping me debug the GreedyMeshing algorithm
ImpartialNumber, for helping with networked playtesting. (my #1 playtester)
Cswic, for being one of the uSDK creators

## --------- Installation ----------------

Must first install UE4.20, and then get ahold of the Mordhau uSDK 1.1.
Clone this git repo and merge this repo and the uSDK.  The uSDK
is included in the .gitignore so all of those huge binary files (~10 GB)
won't be tracked.
